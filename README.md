The Monkees Official Website - Jack O’Neill

- This project was my first milestone project featuring skills and techniques attained through the first several modules of the course. The aim of the project was to create a intuitive, user-friendly and bespoke website for a band (in this case, The Monkees) in order to show case their members, music and brand in the hopes of resonating with both older and newer fans, hypothetically gaining them exposure. As such, I aimed to present the band’s music, style and characteristics through a website designed to be bright and appealing yet concentrated on simplicity of use as well as building a positive emotional connection with the user.  


Technologies

-HTML

-CSS

-Bootstrap (3.3.7)


UX

- The requirements were to produce a website to display and increase engagement for the musical group the Monkees by targeting older fans of the group as well attracting potential new fans. As such, I aimed to produce a website that highlighted the aesthetic of the Monkees to resonate with long time fans, displayed on a page that was simple and easy to navigate. However, I aimed to embrace the current stylistic and functional uses of HTML and CSS as to give the website a fresh and contemporary look. I used a single scrolling page in my design because I wanted to relay a sense of simplicity and 



User stories

- As a Millennial individual, I want to access an modern and interestingly styled site, so that I can build an interest in and relate more personally with the content.

- As a Gen X individual, I want to engage with nostalgic content that is easily and clearly accessible, so that I can enjoy wholly the content and am guided simply through the user experience.



Wireframes

-I completed my wireframes using www.figma.com. A link is included in my github repository. 



Features

-The site was aimed at displaying content in a simplistic and appealing manner. As such, I included a Navbar which displayed simply links to the contents of the page to allow navigation throughout, which also collapsed into a more compact view for smaller mobile devices. I implemented a carousel at the top of the page to demonstrate modern style technique and demonstrate various pictures of band in action upon immediate access to the site. 

Underneath, I included a short synopsis of the band and individual mini biographies for each member. Below that, I wanted to include an array of photos in a gallery to display various aspects and the character of the band in a collage style, which varied in display properties for different screen sizes. Underneath, I embedded a video of a popular performance of the band’s.  Finally, in the footer I included links to the bands social media and streaming sites for further engagement with the bands content and public presence.


Features Left to Implement

-I wanted to include an Audiobox on the website, but without a stranger knowledge of Javascript at this age of my coding career I felt unequipped to present one which matched the feel and aesthetic of the site. Attempts I made clashed with the style of the site and brought down the UX of the site. 




Testing


-Code tested in the W3C HTML and CSS validation service. I also parsed my CSS through https://autoprefixer.github.io/ to ensure it is as semantic and close to intended  function as possible. 

-Having deployed the site on Github pages upon completion, I was able to view it as intended in both large desktop viewpoint as well as a variety of mobile screen sizes, which, due to the media queries I implemented in the code rendered nicely as intended in these variations. 




In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.


The site engages with conventions common in modern web design, such as the bootstrapped navigation bar, input form and carousel. As such, adhering to certain conventions of web design makes the site intuitive and functionally familiar to a variety of user types. 


For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.



Deployment

This project was written in Cloud9 and was deployed via Github pages 

Throughout the process of designing my website, I pushed my code onto Github pages on several increments. However, as certain aspects of the overall design of the project were altered over time, I don't think the the individual pushes were as clear and uniform as I would have wanted them to be. I would attribute this to a somewhat deviated planning process and is something I will strive to work more closely upon in future development.
